        <h2 class="section-title">The Italian Blue Team</h2>
        <p>The Blue Team (Italian: "Squadra azzurra") represented Italy in
          international contract bridge tournaments, winning sixteen world titles
          from 1957 through 1975. From 1964 to 1969 and during a 1972 comeback,
          the team comprised three regular pairs: Walter Avarelli-Giorgio Belladonna,
          Pietro Forquet-Benito Garozzo, and Massimo D'Alelio-Camillo Pabis Ticci.
          Eugenio Chiaradia and Guglielmo Siniscalco played in early years; Dano
          De Falco, Arturo Franco, and Vito Pittalà in late years. The spiritual
          father, long-time coach, and non-playing captain through 1966 was
          Carl'Alberto Perroux.

        <p>
          Italy won its first European championship in Open teams in
          1951, but lost to the United States in the second Bermuda Bowl.
          However, members of the Italian team, including Chiaradia, Forquet,
          and Siniscalco, continued to prepare for future championships. The
          United States was considered the best team in the world at that
          time, having won two more Bermuda Bowls against Europe. Great Britain,
          France, and Sweden were also strong competitors. But in 1956, the Italian
          Blue Team defeated Bermuda Bowl champion France, earning the right to
          compete in the 1957 Bermuda Bowl in New York City. The Blue Team went on
          to defeat a United States team on its home ground, and this victory marked
          the beginning of a remarkable period of success. With a stable lineup
          consisting of Walter Avarelli, Giorgio Belladonna, Eugenio Chiaradia, Massimo
          d'Alelio, Pietro Forquet, and Guglielmo Siniscalco, the Blue Team won twelve
          world team championships between 1957 and 1969, with only one sixth-place
          finish. The team retired after 1969, but some key members returned to win
          four more world titles from 1972 to 1975. The Blue Team's success was largely
          due to their innovative bidding systems, which were sometimes considered
          strange or even unfair by conservative US circles. Losing teams complained that the
          Italians had an advantage using bids that were incomprehensible to
          Americans. The Blue Team's reign ended in 1976 when the US and Brazil won
          the Bermuda Bowl and Olympiad, respectively.

        One of the best bridge players of all time was Italian. With the
        Blue Team, he won 16 world championships while playing alongside Walter
        Avarelli from 1956 to 1969 and Benito Garozzo thereafter. A renowned theorist,
        he was responsible for developing the Roman Club bidding system starting in 1956.
        With Benito Garozzo, he developed Super Precision, a sophisticated strong
        club-based strategy, after 1969. Consider the Belladonna coup for an
        illustration of how he was renowned for both his brilliant card play and
        his unpredictable temperament. According to his daughter, Belladonna passed
        away in Rome on May 12, 1995, from lung cancer.

        An Italian bridge player, a member of the famous Blue Team, with whom he won nine Bermuda Bowls and three World
        Team Olympiads from 1956 to 1972.
        Avarelli was born in Rome and became a judge there. He first took up rudimentary bridge during World War II when
        more than thirty years old. Along with interests in tennis, riding and motor racing, he was especially noted for
        "his addiction to gastronomy".
        Avarelli was the longtime partner of Giorgio Belladonna using the Roman Club bidding system. They improved the
        system together and presented it in a book that was published in at least two Italian editions, 1958 and 1969.

        An Italian bridge player who was a member of the Blue Team, a highly successful
        bridge team that dominated international competitions in the 1950s and 1960s. He
        played alongside Giorgio Belladonna, another legendary bridge player, from 1956
        to 1969. During this time, the Blue Team won 16 world championships. After
        Belladonna's retirement, Avarelli continued to play with the team and won several
        more championships. He was known for his solid and reliable play style, which
        complemented Belladonna's more unpredictable approach. Avarelli passed away on
        June 30, 2010, at the age of 86.

        replacement for the Bermuda Bowl. He gained the reputation of being the best
        bridge player in the world during those championship years, according to
        many experts.
